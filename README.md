### Description
----
<br>
When a hotkey (default 'c') is pressed a light from the players inventory will be equipped and their currently equipped shield, if any, will be stored to be automatically re-equipped when the hotkey is pressed again. By pressing alt > hotkey the player can assign the currently equipped light as their preferred light; the preferred light will be prioritized whenever a light is equipped using the hotkey. Preferred light and saved shield will be preserved between sessions, though it may get confused between multiple objects with the same Id in the player's inventory.
<br>
<br>
Updates are planned for the future as OpenMW Lua progresses.

<br>

Thanks to the authors of [Torch Hotkey](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45747) (Remiros, Greatness7, NullCascade) for the original idea and the code to *study* and of course also to the OpenMW Devs, without whom this mod would not be possible.

Do whatever you want with it as long as money isn't involved. Credit is appreciated but not required.
